Jaminals
========


## Imagine you're at the worst party- it's one where you wish anything (a meteor? freak tsunami?) would come and take you away from it because it's so... boring? Quiet? Non-collaborative??

## Well you've just been missing the Jaminals application! With Jaminals, a guest, host and DJ can collaborate to build the bossest, most dope playlist imaginable. 

## One of the best parts? As a guest, you don't need to be logged in to participate. You don't have to sign up for **another** username/password. You can just go to the website and join the party!

### The events are listed but you can also search for one, just in case there are an insane amount of parties happening... who wants to scroll?! Not you, so we've got you covered.

### As the guest, once you're on the event page, feel free to add songs from the DJ's library to the party playlist. You'll even get a notification that it worked. But how did we even get to this event? This is all very disorienting, who is driving the car?

### Not everything can be done as an unauthenticated user- if you want to host, you've gotta sign up as a Host. Make sure you check whether you're a DJ or a Host when signing up, or you'll get a box that tells you that you've missed a step. 


### You've decided to host an event, so you need to call up your DJ. The DJ now steps in to create your event:

### As the DJ, your home is unique to you. It shows your events that you're participating in and your song library. Here you can create the most insane rager in history, or a lowkey book club that needs ambient music. It's up to you and the host to decide; we just make applications, not life decisions for you.

### Alright, you and your host have decided to throw a party for their cat! Let's all head over to the Cat Jam. Only... the host wasn't done telling you the information and in your excitement to throw this Jamboree, you've already submitted the form. Wouldn't it be nice to edit your event?

### We've got you covered! Some hosts need a night to think on their rules and information about their soir√©e. Luckily both the DJ **and** the Host can edit the event. That feature- free of charge, you're welcome.

### Now that the DJ has created the event, the Host needs to take control of things. Once they log in and go to their tailored Host homepage, their new event that they've been added to should be there:

### Now with a new event- the Cat Jam! 

### But out Cat Jam playlist is a little... empty.

### Oh no! A party without tunes? We're back to our original scenario. And we really don't want to go back to that desolate wasteland. Thankfully our Host is here to our rescue. The host selects the genre(s) for the party and that pulls the songs from the DJ's library that matches that genre.

### Here the host is adding a genre.

### **BOOM!** Look at that glorious playlist that just autopopulated based on genre. Can you believe that magic?? 

### But if you're a guest and like, oh lame, I really wanted to hear the Backstreet Boys at this event, well remember the beginning of our journey?? You don't even have to have a login to add songs. You can help steer the direction this Cat Jam goes. 

### Now everyone has collaborated and made this party the best possible party for them. Cooperation makes it happen.
## Working together? **DIG IT.**

### Speaking of working together- if you're wondering who built this incredible application, we also have an about page:
